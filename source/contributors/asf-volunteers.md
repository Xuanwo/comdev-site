Here's a list of ASF community members who volunteer to mentor new community members
and/or to be speakers at ASF-related events.

Project names shown in <strong>bold</strong> mean that the corresponding person
is a PMC member of that project.

**TODO**: a [number of pages](/tags/speakers.html) explain how to register yourself as a potential speaker.
These will need to be adapted if we decide to use this page.

to add that info.

This data is combined with public ASF info found under
https://whimsy.apache.org/public/public_ldap_projects.json ,
