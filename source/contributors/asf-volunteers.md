Here's a list of ASF community members who volunteer to mentor new community members
and/or to be speakers at ASF-related events.

Project names shown in <strong>bold</strong> mean that the corresponding person
is a PMC member of that project.

**TODO**: a [number of pages](/tags/speakers.html) explain how to register yourself as a potential speaker.
These will need to be adapted if we decide to use this page.

## List of ASF volunteers

<!--
To add your name to this list, use the same 
format as other entries and keep the list sorted
alphabetically by ASF username. 

You can add additional data such as your personal
website URL, languages spoken, location etc.
to the /static/data/people.json file

This data is combined with public ASF info found under
https://whimsy.apache.org/public/public_ldap_projects.json , 
by a Web Component loaded for this page.

**TODO**: add an "edit in GitHub" link pointing to the right page so that people can add their names
